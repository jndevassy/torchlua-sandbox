# torchlua-sandbox

A sandbox project for experimenting with Torch7 (Lua) deep learning workflows. It includes a convolutional neural network for CIFAR-10 image classification with training, testing, and model persistence. The project demonstrates Lua-to-C++ interoperability using FFI, with example calls into a C++ library built with CMake for OpenCV-based image display. Reference for combining Torch7's neural network modules (`nn`, `cunn`, `optim`) with native C++ extensions.
